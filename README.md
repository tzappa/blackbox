# Black Box Game

## Introduction

Black Box is a game for one player. It is played on a square grid. There are several "atoms" hidden in the grid. The player can shoot rays into the grid from the sides. If a ray directly hits an atom the ray is absorbed (HIT), if a ray only touches an atom, it is reflected according to the standard rules of reflection. The player uses the information gained from the rays to deduce the position of the atoms in the grid.
